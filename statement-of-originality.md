# Statement of Originality

I declare that everything I have submitted in this assignment is entirely my own
work, with the following exceptions:

**Note: these are all just examples: you should delete them all and replace them
with any inspiration/code/assets that you used in your submission.**

## Inspiration

- the idea of animating the `myArray` array using time-varying ellipses is based
  on the <...> example from the p5 Examples page (as noted in the source code
  comments)
  
- the "colour fade" technique used to modify the background image is based on a
  discussion with my classmate Sara Fernandez

## Code

- `myFunction()` contains code taken from StackOverflow (URL provided in source
  code comments)

## Assets
