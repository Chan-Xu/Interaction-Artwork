# Statement of Originality

I declare that everything I have submitted in this assignment is entirely my own
work, with the following documented exceptions:

- the idea of animating the `myArray` array using time-varying ellipses is based
  on the <...> example from the p5 Examples page (as noted in the source code
  comments)

- the code in the `myFunction()` function is based on some code I found on
  StackOverflow (URL provided in source code comments)
